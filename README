•	Consider the scenario that you’re building a social game.  The user performs different activities in the game, activities that are governed by the rules of the game.
•	Social games are extremely iterative.  This means the rules are frequently changing.
•	As a result, we want to keep the “business logic” of the rules separate from the application code so that they’re easier to maintain and iterate.
•	Prototype a preliminary system that would allow developers to define game rules in code and then assert these rules in the context of a basic game.
