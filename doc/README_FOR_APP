= GGAME (generic game)

-	Consider the scenario that you’re building a social game.  The user performs different activities in the game, activities that are governed by the rules of the game.
-	Social games are extremely iterative.  This means the rules are frequently changing.
-	As a result, we want to keep the “business logic” of the rules separate from the application code so that they’re easier to maintain and iterate.
-	Prototype a preliminary system that would allow developers to define game rules in code and then assert these rules in the context of a basic game.

== Examples

Given the specs, I assume this game can vary much over the rules while its not easy to change the 'canvas' (BoardGame, CardGame, ...). Ill assume its a turn-based game and all players are known at the start.
Ill assume ruleset is changing, while game specs and layout (dimension of chessboard, number of cards, ...) is embedded in the code. Obviously, 
this might be easy to change (DRY) and to clone (subclassing chaning just the wanted attributes), but its NOT in the DB.
We need authentication and the following models:

- ''Users''      (i.e. "alice", 'bob', "riccardo"). A user could have an history of won games (in a table on its own) and a score for the Hall of Fame (inside users table?).
- <b>Games</b>      (i.e. #chess, #cheques, :briscola) which defines a ruleset. Since games can vary SO MUCH (think of Chess, 
  Magic the Gathering, Poker, ...), ONE is sufficient. Ill try to model a couple of games representable in a similar way: a Chessboard.
- Match      (i.e. :chess game #123 between :alice and :riccardo )
  This is an instance of a Game and will keep the <b>GameState</b> (score, current player turn, chessboard status, ...)
- Ruleset (i.e. legal move for :Chess). According to the specs, it seems like rules should be in the DB so they can be changed dynamically
  maybe also during the game. When a player tries to do a 'move' during a match. We need some 'static' assumptions to let a programmer inject code
  into the DB remaining consistent, elegant and DRY. In order to do this, we should set some primitives like 'username', 'current_turn', 'is_my_turn?' 
  and so on. The 'static' code must provide the rulesets with primitives to make the lines readable, elegant, and non-repetitive (=> DRY).
  
= Models

== Game

A game should have the following:

- name:string (unique)
- description:text
- active:bool
# - boardgame settings (i.e. 8x8, with initial disposition of pieces)

=== Chess (Scacchi)

8x8 chessboard for 2 players, 16 pieces each (8 pawns, 2 towers, 2 knights, 2 bishop, queen, king).
Every piece has rule movements.

=== Four in a Row (Forza 4)

7x6 chessboard, 2 players, 

=== Rails Madness (just to invent a new one)

10x10 chessboard, 2-4 players

== Ruleset

A ruleset record should have for sure:
- game_id:integer (to contextualize where its applicable)
- title:STRING (Not really necessary, just for ease and for documentation)
- description:TEXT (it would be a WONDERFUL thing if the game was AUTO-documenting!)
- preconditions:TEXT (code which returns true or false, whether the current state of chessboard matches 
  this rule or not)
- action:TEXT code which alters the GameState to another GameState (i.e. "move the pawn.4 of player 1 from 
  D2 to D4 and give turn to Player 2")

It would be great if rulesets for complex games were defined in a Prolog-like style, with inferential engine, like:

  - goal :- legal_move?
  - legal_move? :- your_turn? , move_piece
  - move_piece :- move_queen
  - move_piece :- move_king
  - move_piece :- move_tower(i)
  - move_piece :- move_knight(i)
  - move_piece :- move_bishop(i)
  - move_piece :- move_pawn(i)
  - move_tower(i) :- current_position(i).x == destination_position(i).x
  - move_tower(i) :- current_position(i).y == destination_position(i).y

Again, the Application CODE should provide ease for writing down rules in a concise way so that we dont put a lot of unnecessary 
repetitive code into the DB..

== MatchesHistory

This resumes the games won:

#- game_id
- match_id
- winner_id
- participants (comma separated ID string list, we dont need to do join, its just for the record)
- score
- description
- date_started
- date_ended

== Match

This is basically an 'instance' of a game. You can play chess Game 10 times and have 10 matches of game Chess.
A match has a date start, date end, a final score

- game_id
- date_start
- date_end
- final_score
- a GameState (position of pieces into the chessboard, cards in players hands, ...). This is obviously Game-dependant

Game State is far too complex to model dynamically, so itll be implemented INTO the code itself.
Views will be provided for HTML, TXT, PNG, SVG, ...
